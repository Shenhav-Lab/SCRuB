--------------------------

**<span style="color:lightblue">We are currently in beta testing! Please report any issues you faced while using SCRuB in our [Issues Page](https://github.com/korem-lab/SCRuB/issues).</span>**

--------------------------

Welcome to `SCRuB`! This is a software package designed to provide researchers with a state of the art tool to **<span style="color:lightblue">remove contamination** from microbial datasets.  <br>

In addition to the statistical framework of `SCRuB`, we provide [`preSCRuB`](prescrub_intro.html), a personalized interface to offer user recommendations to **<span style="color:lightblue">optimize negative control strategies** during study design processes. Effective use of `preSCRuB` will allow for even stronger decontamination using `SCRuB` in future analyses.  

## Installation

SCRuB is currently available through our [github repository](https://github.com/korem-lab/SCRuB/]), which can be installed using `devtools`. The main package requirements from SCRuB are `glmnet`, `torch`, and `tidyverse`, which can be installed with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages( c('glmnet', 'torch', 'tidyverse') )
```

Once the dependencies are met, SCRuB can be installed using `devtools` as follows:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("korem-lab/SCRuB")
```

## Getting started

**<span style="color:lightblue">To start using SCRuB, we recommend to follow along with our [tutorial](tutorial.html), which demonstrates the data format needed to set up SCRuB, how to run SCRuB's core funtions, and how to interpret its results.:</span>**
